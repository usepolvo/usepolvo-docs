# Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a crucial aspect of API integration, ensuring that your application respects the usage limits set by the API providers. usepolvo provides built-in rate limiting features to help you manage this seamlessly.

## How Rate Limiting Works in usepolvo

1. **Automatic Tracking**: usepolvo keeps track of your API usage for each service.
2. **Proactive Throttling**: Requests are automatically delayed if you're approaching the rate limit.
3. **Retry Mechanism**: If a request fails due to rate limiting, usepolvo will automatically retry after an appropriate delay.

## Configuring Rate Limits

Rate limits are pre-configured based on each service's documented limits. However, you can customize these if needed:

```python
from usepolvo.stripe import StripeClient

client = StripeClient(rate_limit=100)  # Set custom rate limit to 100 requests per second
```

## Handling Rate Limit Errors

While usepolvo tries to prevent rate limit errors, they can still occur. Here's how to handle them:

```python
from usepolvo.stripe import StripeClient
from usepolvo.exceptions import RateLimitError

client = StripeClient()

try:
    customers = await client.customers.list_customers(page=1, size=100)
except RateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Rate limit exceeded. Retry after {e.retry_after} seconds")
    # Implement your backoff strategy here
```

## Best Practices

1. *Be Conservative:* Set your rate limits lower than the actual API limits to account for other processes that might be using the same API.
2. *Implement Backoff:* For critical operations, implement an exponential backoff strategy in addition to usepolvo's built-in retry mechanism.
3. *Monitor Usage:* Keep track of your API usage to anticipate and prevent rate limit issues.

## Bulk Operations

For bulk operations, usepolvo provides methods that automatically handle rate limiting:

```python
from usepolvo.stripe import StripeClient

client = StripeClient()

async def update_customers(customer_updates):
    results = await client.customers.bulk_update(customer_updates)
    # This method will automatically throttle requests to stay within rate limits
```

By leveraging usepolvo's rate limiting features, you can build robust applications that efficiently use API resources without the risk of being temporarily blocked due to excessive usage.
